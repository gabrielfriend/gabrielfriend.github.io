        Oh my goddd I took so much addy while living in this Russian industrial city in the Arctic Circle.
        <br>
        I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m wearing a white zip hoodie with stars on it.
      </p>
      <p class="normal">
          I was born knowing my passport number. It was my first word.
          <br>
          I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m sitting on a granite bench that weighs 800 pounds and was quarried in Zimbabwe, near their capital city Harare.
          <br>
          I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m eating ginger candy. I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m watching two delicate women climb into an SUV as big as a short bus.

        I did it because I hate women, fusion power, and space exploration,
      </p>
      <p class="normal">
        When a trade is giving me bad energy,
        <br>
        When my chances of success are decreased in both stocks and life in general,
        <br>
        Living in Hawaii Virgo Season,
        <br>
        When the sound waves of the immense aircraft engines, propagating through my teeth, tongue, and palate, change the way food tastes,
        <br>
        Notes of plum, notes of smoke, or a surprising apricot finish,
        <br>
        When I found out my new fianc√©e has the same first name as me,
        <br>
        When powerful low-pressure weather systems disrupt my hormonal balance,
        <br>
        And incredible things I can&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t see at all
