      Oh my goddd I took so much addy while living in this Russian industrial city in the Arctic Circle.

        I was born knowing my passport number. It was my first word.
        <br>
        I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m sitting on a granite bench that weighs 800 pounds and was quarried in Zimbabwe, near their capital city Harare.
        <br>
        I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m eating ginger candy. I&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m watching two delicate women climb into an SUV as big as a short bus.
